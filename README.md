# Marketing Survey Analysis

In this project, I have undertaken the task of providing valuable insights to the marketing team at CodeX, a German beverage company, to enhance its presence in the Indian market. The primary goal of this project is to leverage survey data from 10 cities in India to drive actionable decisions and strategies.
